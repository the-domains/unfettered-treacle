Welcome to the new home for my blog and contact page. I've been waiting for more than a year to launch this new site. The Grid is run by an AI, so it will be a journey for us as I learn how to use the site more effectively. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c9cd8685-9ef9-4ca5-958f-9daa4aea4af1.jpg)

By way of an introduction, I am a novelist and an Air Force Reserve pilot. My day job is Director of Operations for a KC-135 flying squadron. By night I write and wait patiently for the day I retire to work on my novels full-time. Married since 1992 to my best friend, we live in Indiana with our three children still at home and a small posse of animals--four dogs and 2 cats. We have one daughter who has married and moved to the D.C. area to pursue her career as a journalist.

This past June I finished my MFA in Writing Popular Fiction from Seton Hill University. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made. There was a large dose of serendipity involved in finding the program, but I can't say enough commendable things about it, from the faculty to the mentors to the students, it's an amazing place. It's much more than a master's course. I've made friendships and partnerships that will be with me for the rest of my life and career. If you are considering life as a writer in genre fiction there isn't a better place. The alumni, and really everyone involved with the MFA, have created an environment of inclusiveness and encouragement that I'm certain is unmatched in any academic program in the country. The broad expertise and willingness to share is astounding.

Before the MFA I had spend most of my free time finishing my professional military education at the senior level, Air War College. It was mostly a lot of reading about policy and doctrine. I actually enjoyed it, but my career path has plateaued. Now I work diligently, offering what I can to my squad mates, until the fall of 2020, to conclude a 37 year military career and to give rise to my new vocation as a full-time novelist.

In the meantime, I've finished two novels and short story and have four other novels in various stages. I'm hunting for a career partner to act as an agent.
